# Bio-Dog :dog:
## Bio-Dog is an interface built with the Angular web framework. Through it, users can view images of various dog breeds and rate the images positively or negatively. This project uses The Dog API to retrieve resources. Three endpoints were consumed: the first to fetch all breeds, the second to fetch an image based on the selected breed, and the third to submit image ratings.
